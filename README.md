# TEXT-SUMMARIZATION TOOL

The Text Summarization Tool is a powerful application that uses the google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail model to generate concise and accurate summaries of input texts. Built with Flask and Python, this tool leverages a fine-tuned Seq2Seq model to provide high-quality summaries for long articles, documents, or any text input.

## Features

- State-of-the-Art Model: Utilizes the google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail model, a pre-trained Seq2Seq model fine-tuned for summarization tasks.

- User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive web interface with an input text box and a summary output box.

- Fast and Efficient: Summarizes text in real-time with minimal latency.

- Customizable: Easily extendable for additional features or integration with other tools.

## Model Details

- Model Name: google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail

- Architecture: Seq2Seq (Transformer-based)

- Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuned on the cnn_dailymail dataset for optimal summarization performance.

### How It Works

The tool uses the Pegasus model, which is a transformer-based Seq2Seq model pre-trained on large datasets and fine-tuned for summarization tasks. The model takes in a long text input and generates a concise       summary by identifying the most important information.
